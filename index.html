            <h2 class="highlight secondary-title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="paragragh">
                My name is JT. I'm a student at Base Camp Coding Academy.
                We just finished our units on python, and now we are learning HTML and CSS. 
                It doesn't seem too hard. 
            </p>
            <p class="normal paragragh">
                Recently, I've gotten back into playing video games. I've been playing 'Elden Ring' and 'Expedition 33'
                specifically. They're both really good games. I've played Elden Ring before, but I rushed through just to complete the game. 
                This time, I'm taking my time to explore and find everything, and playing the DLC. 
            </p>
            <p class="normal paragragh">
                I also really like superheroes. I'm about halfway through the 'Invincible' comics and I've seen both the new Superman and Fantastic Four movies in theaters. 
                The new Superman movie is one of my new favorite movies of all time. It was so much better than I was expecting. 
                The Fantastic Four movie was also pretty good, especially considering what Marvel has been putting out the past few years. 
            </p>
            <p class="normal paragragh">
                I also watch a lot of YouTube videos. I may or may not pay $14 a month for YouTube Premium (I swear it's worth it).
                I've been watching lots of police bodycam videos and science-related videos. Watching some of those bodycam videos really reminds me 
                how crazy people really are.
